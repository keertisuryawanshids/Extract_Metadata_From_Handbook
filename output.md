##### Quality objectives and overview

 1. Preamble: Qualification objectives at Heidelberg University

###### In accordance with its mission statement and constitution, Heidelberg University’s degree courses have subject-related, transdisciplinary and occupational objectives. They aim to provide a comprehensive academic education equipping graduates for the world of work.
 Consequently, the following competence profile shall be included in module handbooks as a profile of skills valid for all disciplines. It shall be applied to the specific objectives of the individual courses and then implemented in their curricula and modules.  The main points of the competence profile are the following:
 • developing subject-related skills with a pronounced research orientation
 • developing the ability to engage in transdisciplinary dialogue 
 • developing practice-related problem-solving skills
 • developing personal and social skills
 • promoting the willingness to assume social responsibility on the basis of the skills acquired

##### 2. Qualification objectives of the Master of Science programme
 Translational Medical Research

###### Major aims of translational medical research are to translate knowledge, mechanisms, and techniques of basic molecular and cellular research into new approaches for diagnosis and therapy of disease, and also to translate clinical observations back to the laboratory, and back to basic research questions.  Therefore, this Master programme aims to build an interface between experimental basic science, particular methods and models to translate it, and clinical medicine. It trains students with a first university degree (e.g. BSc or medical degree) in the interdisciplinary field of translational medical research between research laboratory and clinics. The MSc Translational Medical Research programme’s subject-related and transdisciplinary qualification objectives are closely interrelated. 

##### Subject-related qualification objectives

###### Graduates of the MSc in Translational Medical Research (TMR) 
  are up-to-date with the latest research in the fields of molecular and cellular biology of
 medical disorders. 
  have an understanding of disease processes on the molecular and cellular level 
  have a good overview of clinical study design, drug development as well as ethical issues
 and formalities regarding research. 
  have a good overview of the cutting-edge methods and current problems in diagnosis and
 therapy of medical disorders
  have an understanding of the players involved in the translational process, as well as the
 translation towards industry

######  can apply their thorough knowledge about the principles of translational research
 techniques to a broad range of medical questions. 
 They have acquired the ability to 
  write a review article, create a research proposal and evaluate proposals from others. 
  present and defend their research orally with a variety of different media
  independently formulate research projects in translational medicine, including identifying
 the research question, the methodology for its solution, and the impact of the results at a practice and policy level. 
  autonomously work on a specific research project in a laboratory or clinical setting and
 participate actively in lab routines such as journal clubs, progress reports and academic discussion.
 In all of the above topics students have a deepened knowledge in the areas from which they have chosen practical courses. 

 MSc TMR graduates have a clear appreciation of the interdisciplinary action needed and the competence to communicate in such a way as to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical research, diagnosis and therapy.

##### Trans- and Multidisciplinary qualification objectives

###### Graduates of the MSc in Translational Medical Research (TMR) have the ability to:

  Acquire knowledge independently and apply this knowledge in practical situations
  Seek, process and critically analyze information from different sources in order to
 develop innovative and creative solutions to research problems 
  Write research proposals and review articles that demonstrate independent thinking
  Communicate questions and findings with others in their field as well as in an
 interdisciplinary setting using a variety of media
  Select the relevant practical tools to answer research questions and work with these
 tools in a collaborative setting
  Design and manage projects
  Work in an international, multi-cultural and multi-disciplinary team, actively
 participating in discussion 
  Provide, accept and consider constructive criticism  Graduates have also gained awareness of relevant international health issues and have developed an overview of the key players involved in the global field of health.

##### 3. Possible career options

###### There are a broad and high range of employment opportunities in academia and industry for the students successfully completing the translational medical research programme. Progress in diagnosis and therapy in medicine, in particular concerning diseases such as cancer, vascular disorders, or nervous system disorders, are no longer achievable without the competent integration of know-how and knowledge at the levels of molecular biology, systems biology and clinical pathophysiology. Additionally, when it comes to developing a new diagnostic tool or therapeutic from the bench to the clinical application, the students

###### graduating from the MSc in Translational Medical Research programme will have decisive advantages over students qualified in classical study tracks such as biology, engineering or medicine. Therefore our graduates have good perspectives both in academia as well as in industry. They are well-prepared to continue with an MD or PhD programme in a basic or applied research or clinical setting. Qualified researchers with at least a Masters degree are also needed in other areas e.g. for validation of translational safety biomarkers, surrogate markers for vascular endpoints, pain research, new tools for the development of novel therapies in psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative diseases etc.
 Examples for employers in academia include Universities, biomedical research organizations such as those found in the Helmholtz Gemeinschaft, Blaue Liste institutions and Max-Planck institutes. Examples in the pharmaceutical industry include Bayer Schering, Merck, Roche, Sanofi Aventis, Novartis and many more. Similar openings are available to TMR graduates in academic and industrial research organizations abroad.

##### 4. The International Master in Innovative Medicine

###### A small number of students from the EACEA-supported Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree “International Master in Innovative Medicine” (IMIM) study the two semesters of the TMR programme as their first two semesters of a 120 ECTS (four semester) international masters programme. After relocating to Uppsala Universitet (Sweden) or Rijksuniversiteit Groningen (The Netherlands) for semesters three and four and finishing their master thesis work and master thesis, they will receive a double degree from the respective universities that they studied at. This track is only open to students who have applied for and have been accepted to the international programme “IMIM” at the main partner, Rijksuniversiteit Groningen. For details of IMIM, please see https://www.innovativemedicine.eu/ and the specific handbooks of this study programme. Differences in the study tracks are detailed below.

##### Overview of the programme

###### The Master course „Translational Medical Research” is divided into 4 modules which follow the idea from “bench to bedside and back” during semester one: Module 1 conveys the basis of medical disorders and disease processes at the molecular and cellular level. In Module 2 students acquire knowledge about current methods and challenges in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of disease, as well as current research approaches in these areas. Module 3 comprises an individual laboratory project. Module 4 focuses specifically on translational medicine. In each of the more theoretical modules 1, 2 and 4 students can choose one practical course in which they become acquainted with the practical aspects of molecular oncology, neurobiology, vascular medicine or other topics. In semester two students follow the final Module 5 which contains a research project, its summarization in written form and its final presentation and evaluation. For the TMR students the research project must be prepared as a written master thesis and the final presentation and defence takes place in form of the final master thesis exam. In contrast to the students studying TMR only, the students incorporated from the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree Programme “International Master in Innovative Medicine” (IMIM) will summarize their semester two research work in a written report or paper, which will also be presented orally similar to the TMR master thesis work.
